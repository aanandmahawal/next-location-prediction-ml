# next-location-prediction-ml

This project predicts the next geographic location of a user based on their movement trajectory using machine learning. It leverages the [Geolife Trajectories 1.3 Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367) and Random Forest regression to forecast the user's upcoming latitude and longitude from temporal and spatial patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts the next latitude and longitude from past trajectory.
- Preprocesses `.plt` files from Geolife GPS data.
- Extracts and engineers features like hour of day, direction, distance, etc.
- Trains separate models for latitude and longitude prediction using ensemble methods.
- Supports custom input for next location prediction.
- Visualizes actual vs predicted locations using scatter plots.

## 🧭 Project Overview
This project aims to predict the next GPS location (latitude and longitude) of a user based on their movement history using classical machine learning techniques. It uses the Geolife Trajectories 1.3 Dataset by Microsoft Research, which consists of real-world GPS trajectory data collected from 182 users over five years.

🌍 Applications
📱 Location-based recommendations and services

🛣️ Traffic and mobility pattern analysis

🧭 Smart navigation and route prediction

🏙️ Urban planning and crowd flow modeling

## 📌 Project Pipeline
### 1. Data Extraction & Preprocessing
Extract .plt trajectory files.

Parse them into a structured format using pandas.

Generate timestamps and derive temporal features like hour, weekday, etc.

### 2. Feature Engineering
Temporal Features:

hour, hour_sin, hour_cos (to capture time-of-day cycles)

Spatial Features:

distance from center (Euclidean distance from trajectory centroid)

angle from center (directional component)

Target Variables:

next latitude and next longitude generated using a one-step time shift (.shift(-1))

### 3. Data Cleaning & Noise Injection
Drop rows with missing target values.

Add Gaussian noise to latitude and longitude to:

Simulate GPS imprecision

Reduce model overfitting

Round coordinates to 3 decimal places for generalization.

### 4. Modeling
Use two separate RandomForestRegressor models:

One for predicting the next latitude

Another for predicting the next longitude

Apply GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.

Use a StandardScaler to normalize input features.

### 5. Evaluation
Metrics:

✅ R² Score

📉 RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Visualization:

📊 Scatter plots of actual vs predicted coordinates

🔍 Feature importance rankings

### 6. Custom Input Prediction
Accept user-defined current location and hour.

Predict the next GPS coordinate using trained models.

## 🧠 Why Random Forest?
Handles non-linear relationships in spatial-temporal data.

Robust to overfitting when regularized properly.

Provides feature importance insights for interpretability.

Easy to tune with cross-validation.
